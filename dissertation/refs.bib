abstract = {Abstract A sample of programs, written in FORTRAN by a wide variety of people for a wide variety of applications, was chosen ‘at random’ in an attempt to discover quantitatively ‘what programmers really do’. Statistical results of this survey are presented here, together with some of their apparent implications for future work in compiler design. The principal conclusion which may be drawn is the importance of a program ‘profile’, namely a table of frequency counts which record how often each statement is performed in a typical run; there are strong indications that profile‐keeping should become a standard practice in all computer systems, for casual users as well as system programmers. This paper is the report of a three month study undertaken by the author and about a dozen students and representatives of the software industry during the summer of 1970. It is hoped that a reader who studies this report will obtain a fairly clear conception of how FORTRAN is being used, and what compilers can do about it.}

abstract="Program slicing is an important operation that can be used as the basis for programming tools that help programmers understand, debug, maintain, and test their code. This paper extends previous work on program slicing by providing a new definition of ``correct'' slices, by introducing a representation for C-style switch statements, and by defining a new way to compute control dependences and to slice a programdependence graph so as to compute more precise slices of programs that include jumps and switches. Experimental results show that the new approach to slicing can sometimes lead to a significant improvement in slice precision.",
